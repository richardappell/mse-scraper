The front of my flat looks out on to a small car park with one space allocated to myself, one to another tenant and three to a cafe (the front of the cafe faces the town high street and thus these three spaces are located at the back of the property. My flat faces the back of the cafe).Last month the cafe decided to open a hand car washing business which involves cars parking up in two of the spaces at the back of the cafe before being cleaned by the owner's teenage son and another young man.  This involves the use of sprayers, polish and other such items. They also provide a valeting service. As a result cars are coming and going at all times. The noise of the business, which starts at 8AM, is most inconvenient. Slippery suds are pooling across the car park. The car park is not supposed to be for customers but rather for residents and staff and is now busy and noisy at all times of the day. More than once waiting cars have parked in my space and at other times have blocked me in. When I challenged the owner of the business she was dismissive and outright rude. I have called the landlord who owns the cafe property but he has refused to do anything as he said it is not his concern. I have called the council who have investigated but told me they are happy for it to continue as the only concern they would have was the environmental impact (apparently the water is being disposed of appropriately - not what I was complaining about!) The owner also claimed the business was simply a 'pocket money venture' for her son to earn a little extra for college which I presume gave the impression that he is only washing cars for his friends or relatives - this is not true, business is booming, employs staff, has it's own website and even an 0300 number registered to it! My question is are you allowed to operate a business within a communal car park of mixed retail and residential use?

In the early days I had a business loan which was paid off years ago. Using WebCheck I could always see a ""mortgage"" registered against the business. I thought this was for my mortgage on the business property, even though it is in my name. Last year the charge was released against the property and was lifted from the title but I noticed the charge was still showing on Webcheck. I then realised it was a the loan settled over 10 years ago, so I filled in a form to register it as settled.Earlier this month I logged into the HMRC tax account to see if I had any tax coding's. It showed I owed just over £100 PAYE dating back to last April/May. It appears an employment allowance EPS didn't go through properly (a known glitch for last year apparently). I have since sent another EPS and this outstanding balance has now disappeared. I was never informed of the outstanding amount and if I hadn't logged into the tax account would still be non the wiser.Another recent event is I switched my residential mortgage for my home.I have no borrowing for the business, no overdraft and have never had one and no business credit cards etc. I've never defaulted on any accounts.The reason I mention all this is earlier this year I applied for an EV lease through the business and was turned down. There is enough in the bank account to cover the EV lease several times over, but of course you are not allowed to pay up front.I'm just wondering why it appears we are not good for credit, if I can check why, and if there is anything I can do to improve it?

may go back to the company he worked for or he may work for a couple of others,
or he may do a wagon driving job for another firm (non construction industry
based) 
He is more than happy and capable to do his own accounting,
and pay tax (if he earns enough) annually.
Someone has now said he HAS to go through CIS with some
companies as a sub- contractor so the deductions are made from the invoice he
puts in and paid directly to HMRC.
Because the 8 – 10 days a month he may work will be varied,
possibly the same thing as he has done for 30 years or something totally
different we’d rather continue as we had originally decided.

If anyone on here can advise on my situation, that would be great. Or alternatively point me in the right direction of 'who' I need to speak to... accountant, tax advisor, business advisor etc... I have three separate .names/brands' one of which is a registered business (LTD) and I am hoping to streamline them all into the one Ltd business. One of these will be easy to incorporate into the Ltd company as it is in part offering a service that the business will offer, so it is a sideways move. The other brand is the bit I am having difficulty with.Brand/company ONE is an editing company. I have been offering editing services to indie authors for the past year. This is not registered and I have not earned above the threshold for taxes, as it has been very ad hoc/part time around my full time job.Brand TWO is an author name. I have started to write and publish my own novels. I have an author name/branding, but this is not registered as a business as I wanted to publish under a 'publishing company' as this is a more professional way to publish as an indie author.Brand/company THREE (you can probably guess) is the publishing company I have set up to publish my own novels through. This is registered as a Ltd company and is VAT registered with HMRC. I also have a business bank account for this company.Now.. here is where I am getting confused. I wish to do two things. (and one of these has two parts lol)1. I want to consolidate the services I offer through the editing business into the publishing business and expand the services I offer... This is fairly straightforward for one of the ways I wish to do so but I am not sure about the other way. The first way is to offer a self-publishing package to indie authors, so this would involve an agreed fee for a set of services, whether that is just editing, or editing and formatting etc etc.. Easy... I am paid by the author, I provide the service(s) done and dusted. The second way is to offer a publishing service whereby I would provide the above services and also publish the authors work under my publishing company. I would then take a percentage of the profits, rather than an upfront fee (or as well as a smaller upfront fee).2. I also want to run my author brand through the registered publishing company. This is for professionalism and tax purposes (I think). I want to be able to purchase covers, and pay for marketing through the publishing company. I also want to pay for cpd/training etc. I understand that I would be able to offset anything to do with publishing, for example a marketing course, or an editing course. Is what I am not sure about is whether I could do the same for training/cpd for myself as an author, like writing courses/books, which are not really 'publishing' related. However, they are for the author (myself) who will in the long run bring in more profit for the publishing company, by improving craft.As you ca tell, I seem to have a tangled web of business/brands and I am not really sure how to structure it all so it is more streamlined and runs under one business for tax purposes, yet I need to market them separately.I am also aware that i will need to almost treat them as two departments: publishing & writing. I want to make a business plan and state how I am planning how to distribute my time between the two departments. I can split my time 50/50 between them and then portion each 50% into work, marketing/advertising, finances, communication... So I can become more organised and more productive.Sorry that was so long. If anyone has any advice at all, I would be extremely grateful.

Brexit.
I will also be looking for an accountant as well. 
Facts (Even if they are obvious):
1.      
I am a UK citizen, born and bred
2.      
I want to be a sole trader at first
3.      
I want to start 6th April 2021 as
that is the start of the fiscal year (I think). I understand there needs to be
pre-preparation, bank account, HMRC etc...
4.      
My websites will be setup to accept Euros as I
have international clients and from my research, they prefer to see everything
in Euros.
5.      
I will be using stripe as my payment gateway.
6.      
I offer the following services:
a.      
Online training classes
b.      
Online IT support and training
c.      
Future goals
                                                              
i.     
Sell online courses + workshops. Complete
package
d.      
We have no physical products.
7.      
I will be using WooCommerce to generate all the
invoices. This gives me a level of flexibility as I can customise the invoices
as I want and need as well as to comply with whatever regulations.
a.      
I will generate invoices for those who will do a
bank transfer.
b.      
I will accept online payments via credit card
and debit card which is pretty much automated.
Questions:
1.      
The invoice will obviously show the total amount
in Euros. What information do I have to show on the invoice?
a.      
My address. Mandatory
b.      
Their address? (This is an interesting one
because I have seen some companies that only show the email and not the client’s
address. 
c.      
Euro Total?
d.      
Conversion amount? 
e.      
GBP Conversion total e.g. 
                                                              
i.     
Total 100 Euros
                                                            
ii.     
GBP Total £92.30
 
2.      
As I offer two different services, I will have
two different websites.
a.      
Can I have the following invoice numbering
system?
                                                              
i.     
Company A: COMP-A-0001
                                                            
ii.     
Company B: COMP-B-0001
b.      
This means at the end of the month I would
provide two sets of invoices. Of course, the payment will go through this same
stripe account as well as bank transfers will go to the same sole trader
account.
 
3.      
Traveling
a.      
From time to time, I will be obligated to travel
to certain countries to meet companies as well as individual clients. 
                                                              
i.     
I would like to know what kind of expenses are
allowed?
Accountant
Can anyone recommend

there.

No transactions or anything.At no point have I set the company as dormant (if that is possible.)After I file the tax return, I wish to close the limited company so I don't have to deal with this again.What is the best way to go about filing this company tax return and then closing the company?I saw a video on youtube from saying that it is possible to file accounts for dormant companies but do you have to first of all set the status as dormant? What do you put in the number of shares and value of each share?Many thanks in advance.",2021-02-24 17:44:00

I've recorded them on my Quickbooks as expenses and kept the invoices but how do I take the money from the business account please to pay back the credit card? I'd initially thought I logged into my credit card and made a payment but I don't think you can pay the credit card off from a business (maybe?). I assume I wouldn't pay it myself as a salary as I would then be taxed on that and it's not pay. Is anyone able to explain this to me in layman's terms please. I'd rather make sure I get all these little things right from the start rather than messing it up and then needing to pay an accountant loads at the end of the year to sort out the mess. Thanks in advance.

Over the past year my business has only been able to trade for 3 months out of 12. I asked my insurance company if they're able to pause or refund part of the payment but they said no. Now it's time to renew and I won't be able to start up my business again probably until the summer, and the insurance company are saying that they still can't reduce the price at all. Have any of you other small businesses managed to reduce your insurance costs? What do you recommend I do?",2021-02-22 14:40:00
